This is a practice Laravel app, I am making it as I study the framework, the final plan for this app it is a simple ecommerce, with integration with paypal for payments, with a platform for the site admin to add new products and see their registered clients and users, for now it is only making the communication with database and displaying some data, I know, it is not pretty, but Iâ€™ll implement all features before worrying about front-end, because my primary goal, it for the app to work properly.
